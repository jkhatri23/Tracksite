Tracksite is a web application that allows users to efficiently manage projects, courses, websites, and applications, providing easy access and organisation of resources

## Features: 
- This React-based Bookmark Manager application allows users to create, view, and manage folders and bookmarks. It uses axios to interact with a backend API, enabling CRUD operations for organizing bookmarks, with real-time updates to folder and bookmark lists upon creation or deletion.
- Utilizes react-router-dom to create a multi-page user interface with routes for Home, About, Folders, and Login. It includes dynamic navigation and a custom logo for a smooth user experience.
- The homepage features a simple and engaging interface where users can navigate to the main app page with a 'Begin' button. It integrates React Routerâ€™s useNavigate hook for seamless page transitions and custom CSS for a clean layout
